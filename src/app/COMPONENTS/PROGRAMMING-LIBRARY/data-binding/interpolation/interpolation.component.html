  <p>
    In any angular html template, you can inject text dynamically. Text can be
    stored within variables in the components.ts file. Through variable
    replacement, you can inject this text into the variable call of the html.
    This requires you to do two things:
  </p>
  <br />
  <ol>
    <li>
      Declare your variable in the components.ts file:
      <br />
      <br />
      <ngx-gist
        [gistId]="'rotechie/1abfb25c97a1f1e6013cbe9584bb3828'"
      ></ngx-gist>
    </li>
    <li>
      Call your variable's name in the template file surrounding it with two
      angle brackets:
      <br />
      <br />
      <ngx-gist
        [gistId]="'rotechie/d8e5a32c3674cf359df30c465f9fcb7d'"
      ></ngx-gist>
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>
