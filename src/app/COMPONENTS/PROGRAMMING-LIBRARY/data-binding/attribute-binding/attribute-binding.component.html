    In order to understand Attribute Binding, it is important to understand the
    difference between attributes and properties.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h2>HTML attribute vs. DOM property</h2>
  <br />
  <p>
    <span>
      Attributes are defined by HTML. Properties are defined by the DOM
      (Document Object Model).
    </span>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A few HTML attributes have 1:1 mapping to properties. <span>id</span> is
      one example.
    </li>
    <li>
      Some HTML attributes don't have corresponding properties.
      <span>colspan</span> is one example.
    </li>
    <li>
      Some DOM properties don't have corresponding attributes.
      <span>textContent</span> is one example.
    </li>
    <li>
      Many HTML attributes appear to map to properties ... but not in the way
      you might think!
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    That last category is confusing until you grasp this general rule:
  </p>

  <p>
    <span>
      Attributes initialize DOM properties and then they are done. Property
      values can change; attribute values cannot.
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, when the browser renders
  </p>
  <div>
    <code
      >&lt;<span class="ega_blue">input</span>
      <span class="ega_teal"> type</span>=<span class="ega_orange">"text"</span>
      <span class="ega_teal">value</span>=<span class="ega_orange">"Bob"</span>
      /&gt;</code
    >
  </div>
  <br />
  <p>
    it creates a corresponding DOM node with a value property initialized to
    "Bob".
  </p>

  <p>
    When the user enters "Sally" into the input box, the DOM element value
    property becomes "Sally". But the HTML value attribute remains unchanged as
    you discover if you ask the input element about that attribute:
    input.getAttribute('value') returns "Bob".
  </p>
  <p>
    The HTML attribute value specifies the initial value; the DOM value property
    is the current value.
  </p>
  <p>
    The disabled attribute is another peculiar example. A button's disabled
    property is false by default so the button is enabled. When you add the
    disabled attribute, its presence alone initializes the button's disabled
    property to true so the button is disabled.
  </p>
  <p>
    Adding and removing the disabled attribute disables and enables the button.
    The value of the attribute is irrelevant, which is why you cannot enable a
    button by writing &lt;button disabled="false"&gt;Still
    Disabled&lt;/button&gt;.
  </p>
  <p>
    Setting the button's disabled property disables or enables the button. The
    value of the property matters. The HTML attribute and the DOM property are
    not the same thing, even when they have the same name.
  </p>
</div>
